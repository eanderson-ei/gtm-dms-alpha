# Install PostgreSQL

Follow the instructions below to install PostgreSQL. Before installing any software, request permission from your system administrator if required.

1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) the installer for your operating system (for Windows, as of this writing, the official installer was hosted on enterprisedb.com). 

2. When prompted during installation, include pgAdmin 4, Stack Builder, and Command Line Tools. The default installation options are acceptable for all other features. You'll be prompted to provide a password for the superuser. Write this down and don't lose it!

3. After installing Postgres, you will be prompted to launch Stack Builder to download additional extensions. Install PostGIS, a spatial extension for geographic data.
