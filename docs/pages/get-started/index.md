# Let's Get Started...

Let's get ready to install Atlas. 

First, you should understand the requirements to run Atlas and the process to set up Atlas.

## Requirements

### Personnel

Atlas should be installed and operated by a person or team with some experience in information technology. Data Stewards, GIS Specialists, and Information Technology Officers are all suitable roles for the Atlas manager, referred to as "Data Steward". 

Experience with relational databases, SQL, Google Apps Script (or JavaScript), and web development are also helpful. 

The Data Steward will not only manage Atlas but also work with each office and with partners to train them on best practices and integrate their data with Atlas, so interpersonal skills are also important. 

### Hardware

No special hardware is required to get started. Components of Atlas, namely the Mission Database, will be installed on a laptop or desktop that meets these requirements:

- 1 GHz processor
- 2 GB of RAM
- 512 MB of HDD

Additional disk space is required for data or supporting components. The Mission Database may be migrated to a remote or cloud-based server if necessary.

### Software

ATLAS requires Google Workspace and PostgreSQL. 

Advanced users may install Miniconda and Git (including GitBash) for additional functionality. Create a GitHub account to customize and share your own version of this documentation. 

Coordinate with your systems administrator before installing any software.
