Atlas requires only Google Workplace and the right personnel. Optional components of Atlas have specific hardware and software requirements, described in detail below.

## Personnel

To get the most out of Atlas, you should have available the following capacities. These capacities may be found in a single person or, more likely, a team with complementary skills:

* **Data Steward:** the Data Steward manages and maintains the Atlas system, works with Mission staff and partners to use Atlas tools and templates appropriately, and manages data reporting tasks. This role is sometimes also supported by an Information Coordinator. Knowledge of database management systems and SQL are important. The Data Steward will also work with technical teams and partners to train them on best practices and integrate their data with Atlas, so interpersonal skills are also important.
* **GIS Specialist:** the GIS Specialist provides the technical expertise necessary to manage geospatial data, conducts spatial analyses to support technical teams, and consults with partners on best practices for geospatial data collection and use.
* **Apps Script Developer:** the Developer uses their specialized expertise to maintain and expand the functionality of the Atlas tools built on Google Apps Script. 

## Optional Requirements

### Hardware

Optional components of Atlas, namely the Mission Database, must be installed on a laptop or desktop that meets these requirements:

- 1 GHz processor

Additional disk space is required for data or supporting components. The Mission Database may be migrated to a remote or cloud-based server if necessary.
