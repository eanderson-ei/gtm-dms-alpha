# Next Steps

Basic setup of Atlas is now complete. 

Advanced users may choose to continue with the optional set up steps in the next section.

All users are now ready to begin compiling and cataloging existing data and onboarding the Mission and partners to Atlas. Onboarding the Mission will depend on how well your Mission is already complying with data-related Agency requirements and the existing capacity and culture within the Mission and partners.

The [Playbook](../../knowledge/playbook/index.md) has recommended methods for supporting your Mission during onboarding to Atlas. If you are not setting up optional components, go there next to develop a roadmap for roll out of Atlas to the Mission.
