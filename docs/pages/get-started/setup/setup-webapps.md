# Set up Web Applications

Web applications make data discoverable by stakeholders. Many of the applications are available in the [USAID/Guatemala Data Hub](https://sites.google.com/usaid.gov/guatemaladatahub/home). The primary web applications available currently include

- **Data Catalog**: a searchable Google Sheets-based data catalog
- **Map Viewer**: create choropleths from tabular data
- **Activity Location Data Portal (Public)**: Implementing Partner Activity Location Data generalized for public consumption.

All web applications used by Atlas are stored in the [gtm-apps GitHub repository](https://github.com/eanderson-ei/gtm-apps). Select the best options for your Mission and follow the instructions there to install.
