# Setup Overview

Initial set up of Atlas is quick and easy. You will realize many benefits from Atlas after compiling and cataloging the data you already have in the Mission. Rolling out all components of Atlas to the Mission and partners is a long term project which will develop the capacity and culture required to empower teams with a data-informed, geographic approach to development.

The following pages walk you through the initial deployment of Atlas. Follow the instructions in the order presented (see the **Next** button on the page footer). The section **Optional Setup** describes optional components and options for advanced users not required for basic use of Atlas.
