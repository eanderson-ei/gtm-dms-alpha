# Activity Folder

* Gsheets or Excel or allow either?
* Can they interact with Google Drive at all? (What if they don't have a google account and aren't allowed to create one?)



```bash
*
+-- datasets/
    +-- dataset1.gsheet
+-- Data-Inventory.gsheet
+-- Activity-MECLA-Plan-DMP.gdoc
+-- Activity-Location-Data-Template.gsheet
+-- Activity-PM-Tracker.gsheet // optional
```



## Mission Drive Organization

* Add link to Activity Folder in the Activity DB to allow A/CORs maximum flexibility (until Shared Drives are rolled out).

* Create central repo for MECLA-related data
  * DIS PM reports as JSON files?
  * Archive of most valuable Activity Folder datasets? e.g., activity location data? If so, on what timeline? Quarterly? How to address taskers (Ambass. needs it now)?
  * Use the ALD Processor to concatenate all Activity Location Data for the Activity Location Data Portal; how/when to ingest into Database?
  * 



* Which Activities have we met with that we can build a version of the activity folder?
  * Nexos Locales
  * Coffee Value Chains
  * CEO
  * Puentes (Activity Tracker)



## Nexos Locales

```bash
*
+-- datasets/
    +-- implementation-activities.gsheet
    +-- beneficiaries.gsheet
+-- Data-Inventory.gsheet
+-- Activity-MECLA-Plan-DMP.gdoc
+-- Activity-Location-Data-Template.gsheet
+-- Activity-PM-Tracker.gsheet // optional
```

* How to convert implementation activities to Activity Location Data tracker?
  * Probably just ask them to convert the data and add it
