# Activity Location Data Tracker

The Activity Location Data Tracker is a template for partners to report Activity Location Data. It is stored within the Activity Folder template; a copy is created for each new Activity (see the workflow [here](../usage/onboard-activity.md)).

The Activity Location Data Tracker is a Google Sheets equivalent of the batch upload template available on DIS. Atlas does not currently support customization of this template.
