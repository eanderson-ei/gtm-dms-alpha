# H3

[H3](https://h3geo.org/) is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system, developed by [Uber](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/).

H3 has become popular in the geospatial community for indexing and aggregating spatial data at multiple spatial scales. H3 partitions the world into overlapping hexagonal grids. The H3 Core Library is written in C, however bindings for many other languages are available, including JavaScript, Python, R and PostgreSQL.

Atlas uses the [h3-js](https://github.com/uber/h3-js) library to generalize Activity Location Data at hexagon resolution six.
