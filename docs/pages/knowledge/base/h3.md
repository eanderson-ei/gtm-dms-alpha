# H3

[H3](https://h3geo.org/) is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system, developed by [Uber](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/).

H3 has become popular in the geospatial community for indexing and aggregating spatial data at multiple spatial scales. H3 partitions the world into overlapping hexagonal grids. The H3 Core Library is written in C, however bindings for many other languages are available, including JavaScript, Python, R and PostgreSQL.

Atlas uses the PostgreSQL binding for H3 to generalize Activity Location Data at hexagon resolution six. A view in PostgreSQL is used to assign the hierarchical identifier to each record. These data are then manually copied to the Generalized Activity Location Data Google Sheet for use by the Activity Location Data Portal - Public.
