# H3

[H3](https://h3geo.org/) is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system, developed by [Uber](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/).

H3 has become popular in the geospatial community for indexing and aggregating spatial data at multiple spatial scales. H3 partitions the world into overlapping hexagonal grids. 

Atlas uses the [h3-js](https://github.com/uber/h3-js) library to generalize Activity Location Data at hexagon resolution six. Bindings are also available for PostgreSQL ([H3-pg](https://github.com/zachasme/h3-pg)) and Python with pandas ([h3pandas](https://h3-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

This [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1794pBBGK_8l1wBG2Zj_BaE0vUxW3tM5K) extracts the h3 hexagons clipped to a country boundary for mapping in the [Activity Location Data Portal (Public)](../../components/ald-portal-public.md).
