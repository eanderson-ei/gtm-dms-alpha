# Incorporating Atlas in the IGCE

Partners should set aside sufficient budget to meet requirements for data collection and sharing. The Mission should ensure that the requirements are clearly defined in solicitation and award language. When issuing the request for proposals, the Mission will develop an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) to estimate these costs.

This guide supports the Mission in developing the IGCE for the functions of Monitoring, Evaluation Collaborating, Learning and Adapting (MECLA) to better evaluate pr.

## Introduction

There is no one-size fits all approach to Monitoring, Evaluation, Collaboration, Learning & Adapting (MECLA). The resources required for MECLA will depend on the size of the award, the anticipated MECLA needs, and the desired approach to MECLA. USAID recommends that funding for MECLA should total four to thirteen percent, on average, of an OU’s program funds, including one to three percent for evaluation and another three to ten percent for monitoring and CLA activities[^1]. In budgeting for MECLA within Activities, each OU may compare current planned spending to these benchmarks to determine the adequacy of MECLA within and across Activities.

## Process

1. **Obtain a copy of the IGCE Template:** The estimate for MECLA activities should be developed in a dedicated copy of the USAID IGCE Template (always use the latest template available on GLAAS). 
2. **Compile the necessary supporting documentation:** Supporting documentation may include (a) Activity Statement of Work Draft, (b) Requirements for the type of instrument for the Award, and (c) Estimates for Labor Costs (level of effort and labor rates), Other Direct Costs (number of trips, per diem days, workshops and their respective unit costs), and Other Costs (Indirects and Fee) for similar Activities completed in the past.
3. **Update draft Scope of Work**: review the MECLA requirements and common tasks described in the section MECLA Tasks, below, to ensure MECLA is appropriately reflected in the draft Scope of Work.
4. **Estimate costs:** considering the anticipated MECLA activities and cost considerations, estimate costs for each of the cost categories in the IGCE. Additional guidance is provided below.

## MECLA Tasks

This section describes typical MECLA requirements and tasks to consider when estimating costs. Each Activity will be unique. Ensure that sufficient resources are budgeted to allow the Implementing Partner to comply with all USAID regulations as well as fulfill the important functions of MECLA during activity implementation.

### Requirements

Table 1 describes the primary requirements for Activities related to MECLA. These requirements are defined in the Automated Directive System (ADS) and Mission Performance Management Plan (PMP). Ensure that these requirements are included in the award agreement, described in the draft Scope of Work, and budgeted for in the IGCE.

Note that some MECLA tasks will be led by Mission staff or independent third-parties, including conducting Data Quality Assessments (DQAs; ADS 201.3.5.7) and collecting and utilizing beneficiary feedback (ADS 201.3.4.10, B). If using a third-party for these requirements, include budget in the IGCE under the Contractual/Consultants category.

### Common Tasks

This section describes, in general terms, common MECLA-related tasks. These tasks should be reflected in the draft Scope of Work as well as the IGCE. Consider how the Implementing Partner will complete these tasks when estimating costs for each cost category.

**Set Up & Systems Maintenance:** the Implementing Partner may need to hire or contract for MECLA roles; evaluate, purchase and set up hardware and software to facilitate MECLA, and maintain those teams and systems over the life of the contract. In addition, during the inception phase the activity’s MECLA team will develop the Activity MECLA Plan and Data Management Plan (DMP), draft Performance Indicator Reference Sheets (PIRS), establish baselines and targets, and adapt the MECLA systems as needed. 

**Data Collection & Management:** data collection and management is an important consideration for MECLA. Consider how the Implementing Partner will collect data given the geographic focus of the Activity, the location of implementation activities and intended beneficiaries, and the location of Implementing Partner offices. Note that data collection may be incidental to other implementation activities and thus the costs will be accounted for elsewhere. The Implementing Partner may need to develop data collection instruments and design a data management system. If the Activity includes research on human subjects, additional time should be allocated for review by an Institutional Review Board and develop informed consent forms. Collected data, especially data containing sensitive information and PII must also be protected and shared responsibly. Finally, internal data quality assessments should be completed regularly. 

**Performance Management:** Implementing Partners are required to analyze and use performance, risk, and context monitoring to learn, inform management and adapt interventions. Often this is done in concert with the A/COR and others on the Technical Team. Include tasks to analyze data, prepare reports, and participate in regular performance management meetings with the Technical Team. 

**Reporting:** USAID requires that collected data and intellectual works, such as reports, are submitted to the appropriate repositories. Performance data must be submitted to the Mission at the required reporting frequency. The minimum frequency is annual reporting, but often implementers are reporting more frequently. Thematic data[^2] must also be submitted to DDL within 90 days of its use (or fitness for use) in an intellectual work. Reports and other intellectual works must be submitted to the Development Experience Clearinghouse. Allow 1-2 days per dataset for submission to the DDL and DEC. 

**Evaluation:** Internal evaluations (conducted/commissioned by USAID or by the implementing partner) may be included to assess various aspects of the implementation of or outcomes from the Activity. Note that internal evaluations do not count towards the requirements for evaluations described in ADS 201.3.6. If an external evaluation (led by an expert external to USAID who has no fiduciary relationship with the implementing partner) is planned, also consider additional tasks or costs to the Implementing Partner to enable the independent evaluation. See [Guidance Note: Developing an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for a Performance Evaluation](https://usaidlearninglab.org/sites/default/files/resource/files/developing_an_igce_for_evaluations_-_sept_16.pdf) for assistance estimating costs for evaluations.

**Learning:** Learning is an important component of MECLA however no specific requirements for Activities are declared in the ADS. Consider how the Activity may support learning relative to important learning questions for the Activity or for the Mission’s CDCS. Also consider any participation by the Implementing Partner in learning events sponsored by the Mission or others.

## Cost Considerations

How much should MECLA-related activities cost? Ten percent of the total award is a reasonable benchmark for estimating MECLA costs for most Activities. Spending much more on MECLA-related tasks will unnecessarily reduce funds for implementation activities whereas spending less puts the Activity at risk of missing opportunities to optimize performance or creating unintended consequences.

The following considerations may result in more or less than this benchmark for MECLA costs.

- **Size of award:** larger awards will spend more overall on MECLA than smaller awards.
- **Type of award:** acquisition awards may include more MECLA requirements than assistance awards.
- **Type and complexity of data collection:** Activities which need to collate hand-written data (such as from health clinics) or implement large surveys will require more resources than an activity that relies on data collection through participation lists, for instance.
- **Number of subgrants:** awards with many subgrants may require more resources for standardizing systems across multiple grantees.
- **Number of field offices:** more field offices may reduce the travel time to collect data.
- **Proportion US-based staff:** more resources are often required for US-based staff for salaries and travel.
- **Use of contractors and consultants:** using experienced contractors and consultants for MECLA and/or enumeration can reduce costs depending on the type of Activity.
- **Travel required:** travel to collect data and meet with Technical Teams must be considered.
- **Technology used:** digital technologies require more cost to set up and maintain but can be more efficient and accurate than transcribing data.
- Centralization of MECLA roles: the structure of the MECLA team, whether using dedicated staff or existing program staff for MECLA roles, may affect how costs are accounted for in the overall IGCE.
- **Implementing Partner sophistication**: Implementing Partners with experience working with USAID may require fewer resources to comply with MECLA requirements given their experience and existing staff.
- **Number of indicators:** the more indicators employed and disaggregates required will increase overall MECLA costs.

### Cost Categories

The IGCE Template includes many cost categories. For MECLA, the most common cost categories to budget for include personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual, travel, and other direct costs.

#### Personnel

Labor is typically the largest expense to budget for with respect to MECLA. There are many options for composing the MECLA team. For large awards, a dedicated and centralized team of MECLA specialists may be best. For smaller awards, MECLA responsibilities may be taken on by other program staff. Typically, at least one MECLA specialist should be dedicated to managing and performing MECLA work. Review the draft Scope of Work to understand the needs for MECLA to help estimate the time required to complete MECLA tasks. Include sufficient time for non-MECLA specialists to support and participate in MECLA-related activities. Labor costs for personnel are specified as the number of units (months, days or hours) and the unit costs (rate). 

#### Equipment

Vehicles are an expensive cost in the equipment category. If fulfilling MECLA requirements will require a dedicated vehicle or vehicles such as for consistent and remote data collection or monitoring,, include it here. See IGCE guidance for other costs to consider in this category.

#### Supplies

Supplies include computers, servers, office furniture, and other equipment required by the Implementing Partner. Include any costs associated directly with MECLA roles, such as laptops, here. See the *Other Direct Costs* section below for additional hardware considerations. 

#### Contractual

Review the draft Scope of Work, which should now reflect MECLA requirements and common MECLA tasks, to estimate costs associated with contractual obligations for program activities, consultants, and subgrants. 

#### Program Activities

The draft Scope of Work should clearly describe expectations for program activities related to MECLA requirements and common tasks. For additional detail, see the MECLA Tasks section, above.

#### Consultants

When consultants are used to fulfill MECLA roles, include expected costs here. 

#### Subgrants

Subgrantees may also have roles and responsibilities related to MECLA. Include those costs here.

#### Travel

Consider international travel for US-based staff, local travel for performance management meetings, and any travel for data collection not accounted for elsewhere.

#### Other Direct Costs

Software is the most common other direct cost to consider. Be sure to include hardware that meets software requirements in the Equipment category. Also consider costs associated with vehicles, such as fuel, insurance, repairs and maintenance, etc.

Table 2 describes common software and hardware employed by MECLA teams for digital data collection, data management, analysis, and reporting. Include sufficient time in the personnel budget for setting up the system, training users, maintaining the technology and potentially upgrading technology for longer awards. Consider the entire package of software and hardware together. Some software providers package multiple functionalities which can be less expensive than purchasing each functionality separately. Importantly, lower-cost or free options often require more labor to set up and maintain.

| **Software/Hardware**                                        | **Cost Range**                                              | **Range for Estimates**                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Geographic Information System (GIS)**Supports collection and management of geospatial data. Examples include ArcGIS and QGIS. | $0 - $500 /user /year.$2,000 - $2,500 per laptop.           | Budget 1-2 licenses per year. Use high end of range for more complex GIS needs. GIS software requires more powerful laptops than typical standard-issue laptops. Include one laptop per license. |
| **Data Visualization Software**Supports data visualization and reporting. Examples include Tableau and Google Data Studio. | $0 - $900 /user /year.                                      | Budget 1-2 licenses per year.                                |
| **Performance Management System**Support data management, reporting and performance management. Examples include DevTech and AmpImact. | $30,000 - $100,000 to set up plus $25,000 - $100,000 /year. | Scale based on award size (low end for <$5MM award, high end for >$100MM award). See **Database Management System** for alternatives. |
| **Database Management System**Supports data management. Examples include Microsoft Access, Postgres, and Oracle Database. | $0 - $12,000 /year.                                         | Scale based on award size (low end for <$5MM award, high end for >$100MM award).Do not include if budgeting for a Performance Management System. |
| **Field Data Collection Platform** Supports field staff to digitally collect data; includes software and mobile device. Software examples include Survey123 and KoboToolbox. Mobile devices range from smartphones to dedicated units (e.g., Trimble devices). | $0 - $350 /user /year.$250 - $1,000 / mobile device.        | Budget 1 license per field enumerator and at least 1 license for the office-based MECLA team. Budget for 1 mobile data collection device per license. Consider whether the device requires satellite or cellular data collection for real-time data uploads. |
