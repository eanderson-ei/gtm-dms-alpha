# GeoJSON

GeoJSON and TopoJSON are useful file formats for storing geospatial data. Because they are JSON serializable, they can be used in web applications, and are the preferred formats for the [Map Viewer](../../components/map-viewer.md).

If you then need to convert another format to TopoJSON, use [mapshaper.org](https://mapshaper.org/). You can also simplify the polygons, reducing the file size, to facilitate quicker loading and/or analysis.
