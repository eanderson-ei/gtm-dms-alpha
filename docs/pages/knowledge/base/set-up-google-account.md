# How to Set Up a Google Account

These instructions will help partners set up a Google Account for their work email. If the partner cannot set up a Google Account due to IT restrictions, they will need to work with the Data Steward to set up an alternative process for sharing data.

- Open Google.com and click the **Sign In** button at the top right of your screen. If you are already signed in, log out first.

- Click the **Use another account** link to begin setting up a new account.

- Click the **Create account** link.

- Fill in your first and last name, birthdate and any other fields until you arrive at the username screen. The screen may look like this:

- Under the "Username" box is a link that says "Use your existing email" which, when clicked, will allow you to use your work-issued email address. Click the link.

- Enter your work-issued email address in the box. Make sure you have appropriate permissions from your workplace before continuing.

- Click **Next** and finish filling the rest of the form.
