# Continual Improvement

We recommend you set up a continual improvement cycle. During the year, track feedback on Atlas. Once a year, review all feedback and synthesize findings. From the findings, identify recommendations. Work with the appropriate stakeholders to prioritize recommended changes.

### Changelog

Capture changes in the CHANGELOG using the best practices described at [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). 

### Versioning

All templates that are distributed by copy are versioned. This will help you keep track of who is using which version and maintain compatibility with any versions still in use. How to change version numbers is discussed at [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
