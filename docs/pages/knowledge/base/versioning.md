# Versioning

All templates that are distributed by copy are versioned. This will help you keep track of who is using which version and maintain compatibility with any versions still in use. Update version numbers and capture changes in the CHANGELOG using the best practices as discussed at [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
