# Add psql to your PATH variable

Using Windows Explorer, locate the executable for `psql`. This file should be located in the `bin/` folder within the directory you specified when installing PostgreSQL. Copy the path to the file `psql.exe`.

Next, add this path to the PATH variable.

2. Click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under *System Variables*, double-click the Variable "Path" (or select and click **Edit**).
4. In the *Edit environment variable* dialog box, click **New**.
5. Paste the path into the dialog box.
6. Click **Ok** and then **Ok** again.
