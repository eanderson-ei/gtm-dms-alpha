# Institutional Support

## Clarify roles and responsibilities of the program

A critical first step is to establish roles and responsibilities for progressing the roadmap. The Guatemala Mission established the Digital, Data and GIS Program to implement Atlas. The table below descries the recommended roles.

| Role                                                    | Responsibilities                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Leadership Sponsor**                                  | - Defines the vision for how to use data around the Program Cycle<br />- Supports and oversees the Program Owner<br />- Secures resources for continued support of the program |
| **Program Owner**                                       | - Manages and maintains the program<br />- Secures external support when needed<br />- Works with offices and implementing partners in the application of Atlas |
| **Data Steward, GIS Specialist, and other technicians** | - Day-to-day operations of the program<br />- Technical support for users<br />- Analysis and other tasks |

## Analyze capacity gaps

A capacity gap analysis will help identify the types of skills and level of effort required to implement Atlas. The approach taken for this exercise was to list out all expected tasks and ongoing responsibilities for the period of interest, define the skills required, and identify whether those skills were available on the team and if that individual had sufficient time to carry out the task. Where gaps were identified, we evaluated all options and determined the most preferable path forward.

## Plan for data governance

As the Mission collects more data it will need to make collective decisions the data its collected and the data collection efforts. The Front Office, the Resource Legal Officer (RLO), and individual office directors will need to be able to coordinate before sharing data externally or when considering new data collection efforts. 

## Acquire software

Acquiring software for data visualization and GIS will help discover insights and create products that meet the needs of Mission staff. The [DataSeed Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYyIUQo41y0sRLVyInfDjppl4DCr0GWP/view) is the fastest way to acquire Esri ArcGIS and Tableau.
