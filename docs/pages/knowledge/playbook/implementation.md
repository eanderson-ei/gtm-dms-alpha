# Implementation

## Launch the Activity Database

One of the first steps in implementing Atlas with the Mission is launching the [Activity Database](../../components/activity-database.md). The Activity Database serves as the single source of truth for Mission operational data and the backbone of Atlas more generally. Introducing the Mission to the Activity Database will provide them an introduction to this new paradigm of data management.

## Onboard existing activities

Follow the usage guidance to [onboard an activity](../../usage/onboard-activity.md) to Atlas.

When first implementing Atlas, it's important to design a strategy for onboarding existing activities. In Guatemala, we used the roll out of Activity Location Data as a catalyst for onboarding activities. A workshop was held to introduce the data collection process and templates to partners. Partners that volunteered to collect Activity Location Data were then onboarded to Atlas so that their data would be aggregated through the automated data pipelines. We also prioritized outreach to activities near closing to harvest as much thematic data and other activity-level data as possible before it was lost.

## Onboard new activities

Onboarding new activities to Atlas requires engagement from the initial design through solicitation and activity start-up.

### Activity design

The Data Steward should participate in the design of the Activity to support the Technical Team to develop a data strategy for the Activity; understand requirements for data collection, management and reporting; and provide input on the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The Activity Design team must consider the requirements for data collection and submission during activity design so that requirements are reflected in the solicitation, that applicants can plan and budget for data collection, and that awards can require data collection as envisioned by the Activity Design team. 

Following the [Mission Order on Activity Design](https://pages.usaid.gov/system/files/mo_201.7_activity_design.pdf), the activity design team should provide regular design updates to the Data Steward through backstops. The Data Steward should utilize these opportunities to share data standards and requirements such that the activity design team may consider these when preparing the Activity Summary and that any costs associated with data collection and submission are reflected in the estimated budget.

The activity design team should review datasets of the Thematic Database for relevant data that can be utilized or updated by the Activity. For example, could this activity use or update remittance data from the Bank of Guatemala? 

Finally, the activity design team should review existing activities that share the same geographic targeting of the proposed activity. Once the Activity Approval Memorandum is approved, the design team lead (usually the COR) should input the planned geographic targeting of the activity in the [Activity Database](../../components/activity-database.md). The *planned* geographic targeting may differ from the *actual* geographic targeting, which will be ascertained through the collection of Activity Location Data by partners.

### New activity MECLA system workshop

All new activities must participate in a 1-day New Activity MECLA System Workshop during the first 90 days of the award. These workshops include the A/COR, MECLA team, office MECLA POC, partner leadership and partner MECLA team members. This meeting will allow the partner to address questions such as 

1. Which new datasets will be collected (pursuant to requirements of the award)?
2. Which existing datasets will be utilized (either from the Thematic Database or the DEC)?
3. Which existing datasets will be updated through the activity (again, considering both data in the Thematic Datasets and the DEC)
4. What is the timeline for submitting data (consider frequency, deadlines, etc.)
5. How will data be used for learning and managing adaptively?
6. How can data be used to collaborate with others?
7. What risks are presented by the data collection plan?

This meeting can also be an opportunity to train the partner on the standard data collection and management tools of Atlas and Agency systems; however a separate training with primarily technical staff may be more appropriate.

### Work planning

Activity work planning is another important opportunity to ensure that Atlas and MECLA requirements are integrated. Atlas and other requirements should be incorporated directly into the main work plan rather than described in a separate work plan.

### Initial Data Quality Assurance 

Conducting an initial data quality assurance (DQA) will ensure that data are being collected according to the data standards, check for issues with data management systems, ensure data risk mitigation measures are in place, and confirm other elements of the DMP and AMELP are being followed. The initial DQA is a great opportunity to make course corrections before it's too late.

### MECLA Community of Practice

Establishing a community of practice (CoP) to support MECLA specialists, data stewards, GIS specialists, and other technical staff at partners is an excellent way to help partners learn together, co-design best practices, and enforce norms.
