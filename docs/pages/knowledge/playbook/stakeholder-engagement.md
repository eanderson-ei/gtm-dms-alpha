# Stakeholder Engagement

Developing a solution does not guarantee that intended users will use the solution. Both primary users and stakeholders (secondary users) must be engaged to promote awareness of the product, learn how to use the product, and tailor the product to meet their needs.

This template Stakeholder Engagement Plan will help you plan for the roll out of a new tool or product.

## Overview

Provide a high level description of the plan to keep users engaged.

## Communication Plan

Describe how you will make users aware of the tool. Consider using multiple communication channels and audience-specific tactics. The table below provides a framework for quickly building a communication strategy.

##### COMMUNICATION PLAN TABLE

| Objective                          | Audience                     | Tactic        | Lead            | Timeframe                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :------------------------- |
| *Promote awareness of the product* | *Technical Office Directors* | *Email blast* | *Erik Anderson* | *Week of final production* |

## Dissemination Plan

Describe where the tool will be made available to users and how users will receive the tool directly. If relevant, describe how users will access updates to the tool.

## Adoption Plan

Adoption occurs after users are onboarded, increase engagement, and realize sufficient benefits from using the tool to fully adopt it. Onboarding is the first step towards adoption. Engagement entails more substantial or more frequent use of the tool. Adoption describes when the user is using the tool for most if not all of the intended use cases (i.e., not using other tools or workarounds).

The table below will help you walk through this process and test where users might drop off from the adoption curve. Guidance for each section is provided below.

- **Desired behavior:** Describe what you want your user to do at each phase of adoption. Make sure it is an observable behavior.
- **Timeframe:** Describe how long the user will be in each adoption phase. For example, behaviors associated with engagement might happen after one month of using the tool.
- **Test:** Describe how you can test whether users are or are not exhibiting the desired behavior.
- **Metrics:** Describe the indicators that will be measured to provide evidence of whether, and to what extent, users are exhibiting the desired behavior. For example, a web app may measure number of site visits.
- **Red flags:** Describe what to watch out for that might indicate users are falling off of the adoption curve at each phase.
- **Incentives:** Describe any strategies for increasing adoption or mitigating red flags.
