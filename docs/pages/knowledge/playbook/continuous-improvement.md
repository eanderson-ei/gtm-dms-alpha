# Continuous Improvement

A continual improvement cycle ensures that Atlas is constantly improving and integrating user feedback. Follow this simple process to set up a continual improvement cycle.

1. During the year, track feedback on Atlas. 

2. Once a year, review all feedback and synthesize findings. 
3. From the findings, identify recommendations. 
4. Work with the appropriate stakeholders to prioritize recommended improvements.
5. Implement improvements.

Be sure to follow [versioning](../base/versioning.md) practices and capture changes in the CHANGELOG.
