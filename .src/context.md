The Mission Data Management System (MDMS) serves as the single-source of truth for the Mission. 

The **Data Steward** manages and maintains the MDMS. When needed, the **Data Steward** queries the MDMS to respond to data requests from **A/CORs** and other stakeholders. 

**Implementing Partners** submit data to the MDMS according to the requirements of their *Data Management Plan (DMP)*. The **A/COR** coordinates with the **Implementing Partner** during *Activity Start Up* to develop a suitable DMP. 

**Implementing Partners** also submit data to Agency Systems, including the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC), Development Data Library (DDL), and Development Information System (DIS). 

The MDMS prefers using Agency Systems whenever possible and especially if required. However, Agency Systems are not designed to meet all of the requirements of a Mission. Therefore, the **Data Steward** integrates data from Agency Systems. Whenever possible, **Implementing Partners** are not required to submit data to both systems.
