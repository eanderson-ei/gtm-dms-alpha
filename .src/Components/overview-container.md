The MDMS comprises three internal sub-systems
- Mission Database
- Mission File Store
- Mission Knowledge Management

These three systems integrate with Agency Systems (e.g., *DEC*, *DDL*, and *DIS*) to capture all datasets and reports generated by the Mission. 

When an Agency System is the appropriate system, data/reports are submitted by the **Implementing Partner** to that system. 

When an Agency System is not available, the **Implementing Partner** will submit data/reports to their *Activity Folder*, a shared Google Drive folder created by the **A/COR** or **Data Steward**.

In all cases, data must be submitted at the agreed upon frequency and in an appropriate format with all accompanying data documentation. These requirements are specified in the *Activity MECLA Plan* and *Data Management Plan (DMP)*.

The **Data Steward** ensures that any datasets submitted to the *DDL*, *DIS* or *Activity Folder* that are required for Mission-wide analysis are ingested into the *Mission Database*. Metadata, codebooks, and other data documentation submitted to the *DDL* are not directly included, but can be accessed in the Agency System if needed.

Reports submitted to the *DEC* are also copied into the *MECLA Library* which is connected to the Mission's *Knowledge Management* system.

The *Activity Database*, a Google Apps Script tool for storing and displaying Activity information, is also connected to the *Mission Database*.

The **Data Steward** queries the *Mission Database* to conduct analysis and generate reports. Analysis and reports are stored in the *MECLA Library* for sharing and future reference.
